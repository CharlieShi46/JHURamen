Google Fonts
Nunito: I have incorporated the Nunito font family from Google Fonts to ensure that our application has a modern and clean typography. Nunito is known for its readability and comes in various weights, making it versatile for different design elements.


Font Awesome
Font Awesome 5.8.1: To enrich our UI with intuitive icons, I've integrated Font Awesome. This library offers a wide range of icons that cover most UI design needs, enhancing the overall user experience by providing visual cues.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap 4.1.3: For our CSS framework, I've chosen Bootstrap due to its responsive grid system, pre-designed components, and powerful JavaScript plugins. This allows us to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout that works on all devices.

jQuery and Popper.js
jQuery 3.3.1 & Popper.js 1.14.3: These JavaScript libraries are used to simplify HTML document traversing, event handling, and animation. They are also dependencies for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins, facilitating dynamic and interactive components.


Dynamic Navbar Color Change on Scroll
A JavaScript snippet is included to dynamically change the navbar's color upon scrolling, improving the visual integration of the navbar with the content as the user navigates our site.
